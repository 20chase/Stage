This directory should contain sources for Zoo referees.

---

To configure: if you write a referee called "fooref", then update
Makefile.am as follows:
1) Add "libfooref.so" to lib_LTLIBRARIES.
2) Add a line "libfooref_so_SOURCES = A B C ...", where "A B C ..." are the
list of source files needed to build your referee.

Then rerun "bootstrap" and "configure" in the top level directory of the
Stage source tree.

---

To write: the only requirement is that your program provides the following
function:

	ZooReferee *zooref_create( ConfigFile *, int, ZooDriver * )

This function should, obviously, create a new ZooReferee object and return a
pointer to it.  Probably you will want to subclass ZooReferee and override
some of its functions.

---

To load: the config file section that loads Zoo should also contain a line

	referee "libfooref.so"

Alternatively, "libfooref", "fooref.so", and simply "fooref" should all
succeed.

Any other options that your referee will need to know about could also go
into that section, but you are under no obligation to put them there.
