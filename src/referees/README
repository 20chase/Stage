This directory should contain sources for Zoo referees.  At the moment, I
would please ask that all code for a referee be placed in a single C++ file
with extension .cc.  For example, there is already a "myref" referee to be
built: its source file is "myref.cc" and it builds to a "myref.so".

---

To configure: you will need to change the PREFIX variable in the Makefile to
match Stage's PREFIX.  For example, if your player/stage share and lib
directories are

	/usr/local/share
and
	/usr/local/lib,

then PREFIX = /usr/local.

---

To build: if your ref is called "fooref", simply add "fooref.so" to the
REFEREES variable in the Makefile.  Then make / make install.

---

To write: the only requirement is that your program provides the following
function:

	ZooReferee *zooref_create( ConfigFile *, int, ZooDriver )

This function should, obviously, create a new ZooReferee object and return a
pointer to it.  Probably you will want to subclass ZooReferee and override
some of its functions.

---

To load: the config file section that loads Zoo should also contain a line

	referee "fooref.so"

Any other options that your referee will need to know about could also go
into that section, but you are under no obligation to put them there.
