-- TODO --

 - 3d ray tracing
 - GUI rotations
 - docs
 - gripper
 - power
 - energy
 - pucks


-- DONE --

 - collapse all stg_X player drivers into a single driver with
multiple interfaces. See note in stg_driver.cc

-- Large Scale Robotics paper
 - 0.01M robots
 - two or three benchmark controllers
 - experimental design

 - sensible defaults - laser (all devices)
    - where to put default values? in each model seems better than the
      header file
