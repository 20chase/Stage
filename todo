-- TODO --

ESSENTIAL
 - save bug = need to save > 1 time before changes take ! 
 - 3d ray tracing
 - docs
 - finish CMake scripts

NICE
 - gripper
 - pucks
 - power
 - energy


-- DONE --

 - clean up graphics implementation
 - collapse all stg_X player drivers into a single driver with
multiple interfaces. See note in stg_driver.cc

 - GUI rotations

-- Large Scale Robotics paper
 - 0.1M robots
 - two or three benchmark controllers (ended up as 1)
 - experimental design

 - sensible defaults - laser (all devices)
    - where to put default values? in each model seems better than the
      header file
