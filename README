This README provides a quick-start guide to building and running
Stage.  Consult the Stage User Manual for full details.

-- What is Stage? ---------------------------------------------------------

Stage simulates mobile robots and sensors in a two-dimensional
bitmapped environment containing a variety of objects. Robots are
controlled through Player. Player provides a powerful, flexible
interface to a variety of robot hardware; Stage provides virtual
devices for Player. Various sensor models are provided, including
sonar, scanning laser rangefinder, color blob tracking from a
pan-tilt-zoom camera and odometry. Several controllers designed in
Stage have been demonstrated to work on real robots.

Stage is developed at USC Robotics Research Lab and HRL Laboratories
to support research into multi-agent intelligent autonomous systems.

-- How to get Stage -----------------------------------------------------

The primary source for Player and Stage is:

http://playerstage.sourceforge.net

-- Ownership ------------------------------------------------------------

Stage is released under the GNU General Public License.

Stage's development is supported at the University of Southern
California and HRL Laboratories LLC by DARPA IPTO.

-- Whats here? ------------------------------------------------------------

stage    - the simulation engine.
       
Some example environments and setup files are provided, along with a
manual and this bootstrap documentation

-- Requirements ------------------------------------------------------------ 

Developed and tested under Linux kernel 2.4, glibc-2.  Written in
reasonable ANSII/POSIX so should compile elsewhere. No promises, but
people have found it to work on a variety of set-ups.

Requires: Player [http://playerstage.sourceforge.net], X11R6, GTK.

-- Compiling ---------------------------------------------------------------

0) Obtain and install Player (http://robotics.usc.edu/player)

1) unpack the Stage tarball with

$ tar xzvf Stage-<version>.tgz

2) Check the top-level makefile (stage/Makefile.common). You must set
the path to your Player source directory. Other settings, such as
installation directory and the location of X11's color database can
also be made here. If you have trouble compiling, you should first
check these settings.

3) compile stage:

$ cd stage-<version>
$ configure
$ make

will build the binary src/stage.

Optionally, as you can do:
 
$ make install

this will install the executables in $HOME/stage-<version>/bin/
(unless you otherwise configured the installation target in
Makefile.common)

-- Running ---------------------------------------------------------------

To run stage, first make sure the Player executable can be found in
your path.

To run stage itself do:

$ stage [options] <filename.world>

The .world file specifies what stage must simulate. The command-line
options are described in the manual, and can be listed by doing:

$ stage -?

To try out Stage with an example world, change to the installation
directory and do:

$ bin/stage worlds/simple.world

-- Configuration file ----------------------------------------------------

The user defines a world to simulate in Stage's configuration
(*.world) file. The world file format is documented in the manual, but
you can get the idea from looking at the examples.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Enjoy, and let us know what you do with Stage.
