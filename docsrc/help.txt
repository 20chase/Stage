@page intro Introduction to Stage (libstageplugin)

Stage is a plugin driver for the Player robot server. It provides a
population of mobile robots, sensors and environmental objects in a
two-dimensional world. Stage is designed with multi-agent systems in
mind, so it provides fairly simple, computationally cheap models of
lots of devices rather than attempting to emulate any device with
great fidelity. This design is intended to be useful compromise
between conventional high-fidelity robot simulations, the minimal
simulations described by Jakobi\cite{jakobi:radical}, and the
grid-world simulations common in artificial life
research\cite{wilson:animat}. We intend Stage to be just realistic
enough to enable users to move controllers between Stage robots and
real robots, while still being fast enough to simulate large
populations. We also intend Stage to be comprehensible to
undergraduate students, yet sophisticated enough for professional
reseachers.

Access to the robots and sensors simulated in Stage is provided by
Player. Users write robot controllers and sensor algorithms as
`clients' to the Player `server'. Typically, clients cannot tell the
difference between the real robot devices and their simulated Stage
equivalents (unless they try very hard). We have found that robot
controllers developed as Player clients controlling Stage robots will
work with little or no modification with the real robots and vice
versa. With a little care, the same binary program can often control
Stage or real robots without even being recompiled. Thus the
Player/Stage system allows rapid prototyping of controllers destined
for real robots. Stage can also be very useful by simulating
populations of realistic robot devices you don't happen to own.
  
Player also contains several useful 'virtual devices'; including some
sensor pre-processing or sensor-integration algorithms. These were
tricky to use with previous versions of Stage, but this release makes
it simple to take full advantage of Player.

Stage provides several sensor and actuator models, including sonar or
infrared rangers, scanning laser rangefinder, color-blob tracking,
fiducial tracking and mobile robot bases with odometry. 

<i>Note:
Some models from previous versions may not yet be available in this
release, but we're working on them. Let us know which ones you need.
