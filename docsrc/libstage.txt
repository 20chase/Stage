@mainpage libstage Reference Manual

libstage (The Stage Library) provides a C code library for simulating
a population of mobile robots and sensors. It is usually used as a
plugin driver for <a
href="http://playerstage.sf.net/player/player.html">Player</a>, but it
can also be used directly to build custom simulations.

libstage is modular and fairly simple to use. The following code is
enough to get a complete robot simulation running:

@verbatim
#include "stage.h"

int main( int argc, char* argv[] )
{ 
  stg_init( argc, argv );

  stg_world_t* world = stg_world_create_from_file( argv[1] );
  
  while( (stg_world_update( world,TRUE )==0) )
    {}
  
  stg_world_destroy( world );
  
  return 0;
}
@endverbatim
