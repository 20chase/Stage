@mainpage The Stage Library (libstage)

The Stage Library (libstage) provides a code library for simulating a
population of robots. It is designed to be used by robotics
researchers for building custom simulations, and as the simulation
engine for Stage, the plugin driver for Player.

Libstage is modular and fairly simple to use. The following code is
enough to get a complete

@verbatim
#include "stage.h"

int main( int argc, char* argv[] )
{ 
  // initialize libstage
  stg_init( argc, argv );

  stg_world_t* world = stg_world_create_from_file( argv[1] );
  
  while( (stg_world_update( world,TRUE )==0) )
    {}
  
  stg_world_destroy( world );
  
  exit( 0 );
}
