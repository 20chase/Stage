## IN PROGRESS #####################################################################

## URGENT ##########################################################################

 - stage documentation
 - xs documentation
 - change laser beacon detection ranges based on laser resolution
 - remove blocking read from playermulticlient so XS doesn't block

## NICE ############################################################################

 - nice up player output to show all port numbers and hostname that connects
 - configuration file write: save only relevant state
 - add vision device sensor display - skeleton is in place

## FIXED/DONE ######################################################################

RTV 9/23/01
 - LBD bug: IDs intermitently visible
   fixed a bug whereby the laser was keeping an old list of beacons
   around when it was unsubscribed, meaning that beacon occlusion didn't
   work properly. removed some buggy code that was probably meant to solve this
   problem.
 - after discussion, changed timing model in main loop to have fixed time
   steps and real-time intervals. added configuration code to manage this.
   this lets us vary the sim/real time ratio nicely and should make the 
   sim more deterministic.
 - fixed truth server bug.

RTV 9/22/01
 - re-implemented signal-based timing in world's update loop, so it'll
   use as much processor as it needs to try to keep at 50Hz
 - XS: hangs when creating a Player client for a non-existent Player  
 - Stage/XS: added support for distributed processing
 - added manager program for multiplexing truth servers
 - XS: fixed window redraws of sensor data, added selective sensor display (num keys)
 - configuration file read: 'port' settings are sticky
 
RTV 9/21/01
 - XS: add player interface to display sensor data

RTV 9/20/01
 - added ACTS channel congfiguration to .world file
 - vision device is broken since color specification changed

RTV 9/19/01
 - objects should accept color specification instead of channels once again
 - reduced memory use by shrinking matrix book-keeping buffers

RTV 9/18/01
 - spawn XS by default in stage 
 - enable external servers by default
